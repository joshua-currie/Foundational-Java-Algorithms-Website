                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Given a graph in the form of an adjacency matrix, an integer representing the number of nodes
                    in the graph, and an integer representing the starting node, will find the shortest path distance
                    between the starting node and every other node in the graph. It is important to note that this
                    algorithm can not handle negative edge weights.
                </p>

                <p>First a distance array and a visted array are created. The distance array represents the current known
                    shortest distance from the starting node to every other node where each index represents node in the graph.
                    The distance array is first initialized to INFINITY except for the index representing the starting node which
                    is initialized to 0.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The visited array is a boolean array that represents where a node in the graph has been visted yet. The visted
                    array is first initialized to false except for the index representing the starting node which is initialized
                    to true.
                </p>

                <p>It then looks at the nodes adjacent to the current node and compares which one has the smallest edge weight.
                    The node with the smallest edge weight is then considered visited and the total distance from the starting node
                    to this node is the gurenteed smallest path for this node. 
                </p>

                <p>This process then repeats by looking at the nodes adjacent to the current node until all the nodes are considered visted.
                    Sometimes nodes in a graph are inpossible to reach, therefore their distance will always be considered infinity.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Input Requirements</h4>
                <p>Takes in three command line arguments. The first argument is an integer that represents the total number of nodes in the
                    graph.
                </p>

                <p>The second argument is also an integer that represents which node is the starting node (please node that node 0 is
                    not a valid node, the smallest possible value for this argument is 0). 
                </p>

                <p>The third argument is a string that represents all the edges between nodes in the form
                    (first-node)/(second-node)/(connecting-edge-weight) with each group of three values separated by a comma.
                </p>

                <p>Note that the main method in the program converts this input into an adjacency matrix before passing that matrix
                    into the Dijkstra's Algorithm method.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Example Input and Output</h4>
                <p><b>Input: </b>4 1 1/2/5,1/3/8,2/3/9,2/4/2,3/4/6</p>
                <p><b>Output: </b>Shortest path between node 1 and every other node using Dijkstra:</p>
                <p>Node 1	 Distance: 0</p>
                <p>Node 2	 Distance: 5</p>
                <p>Node 3	 Distance: 8</p>
                <p>Node 4	 Distance: 7</p>

                <br>

                <h4>Time and Space Complexity</h4>
                <p>Worse case time: <b>O(|V|+|E| log|V|)</b></p>
                <p>Best case time: <b>O(|V|+|E| log|V|)</b></p>
                <p>Average case time: <b>O(|V|+|E|)</b></p>
                <p>Worse case space: <b>O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)</b></p>
                <p>Best case space: <b>O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)</b></p>
                <p>Average case space: <b>O(|V|<sup>2</sup>)</b></p>

                    Copy and paste the Java code here.
    
                    Remember to put the input for the program in the text box that says "CommandLine Arguments"
                    in the correct format based on the program you are running.
    
                    Don't worry about putting anything inside the "Stdin Inputs" box.
    
                    After that press "Execute" to run the program!
