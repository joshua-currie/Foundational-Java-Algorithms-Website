                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>Given a graph in the form of an adjacency matrix, an integer representing the number of nodes
                    in the graph, an integer representing the starting node, and an integer representing which
                    graph theory algorithm to perform, will perform that algorithm onto the graph.
                </p>

                <p>The options for graph theory algothims are: Dijkstra's Algorithm (1), Bellman-Ford Algorithm (2), and
                    Floyd-Warshall Algorithm (3).
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Input Requirements</h4>
                <p>Takes in four command line arguments. The first one being a number from 1-3 that signifies which graph theory
                    algorithm to use.

                <p>The second argument is an integer that represents the total number of nodes in the graph.
                </p>

                <p>The third argument is also an integer that represents which node is the starting node (please node that node 0 is
                    not a valid node, the smallest possible value for this argument is 0). Also note that if you are using Floyd-Warshall
                    you must still put a random integer to be ignored as a third command line argument even though Floyd-Warshall does not
                    need a starting node in order for the program to compile correctly.
                </p>

                <p>The fourth argument is a string that represents all the edges between nodes in the form
                    (first-node)/(second-node)/(connecting-edge-weight) with each group of three values separated by a comma.
                </p>

                <p>Note that the main method in the program converts this input into an adjacency matrix before passing that matrix
                    into the appropriate algorithm method.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Example Input and Output</h4>
                <p><b>Input: </b>2 4 3 1/2/5,1/3/8,2/3/9,2/4/2,3/4/6</p>
                <p><b>Output: </b>Shortest path between node 3 and every other node using Bellman-Ford:</p>
                <p>Node 1	 Distance: 8</p>
                <p>Node 2	 Distance: 8</p>
                <p>Node 3	 Distance: 0</p>
                <p>Node 4	 Distance: 6</p>

                <br>

                    Copy and paste the Java code here.
    
                    Remember to put the input for the program in the text box that says "CommandLine Arguments"
                    in the correct format based on the program you are running.
    
                    Don't worry about putting anything inside the "Stdin Inputs" box.
    
                    After that press "Execute" to run the program!
